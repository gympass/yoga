## Borders

A border is a visual attribute that you can apply to a shape. We use three kinds
of borders to differentiate elements.

### Usage

This is a simple usage:

```javascript type=highlight
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { theme } from '@gympass/yoga';

const MyCoolComponent = styled.div`
  border: ${theme.borders.medium}px solid rgba(215, 215, 224, 0.7);
`;
```

<ThemeBorders />
