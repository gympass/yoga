## Theme

We consider our theme as the **decision** we make besides all our **options**,
aka [tokens](https://gympass.github.io/yoga/guidelines/tokens/borders).

There is a variable responsible for providing all those settings through the
ThemeProvider, from styled-components. Although, there is a theme file for each
component, aiming to have the native and web styles in the same place, following
the pattern of `Component.theme.js`.
