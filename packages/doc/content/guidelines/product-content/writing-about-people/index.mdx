## Writing about people

We write with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an
end-user, a gym or a corporate client, it's important to write for and about
other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful.

### Age

Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or
“elderly.” For us, everybody is a protagonist and has the same importance.

### Gender and sexuality

Avoid gendered terms, we are in favor of neutral alternatives.
