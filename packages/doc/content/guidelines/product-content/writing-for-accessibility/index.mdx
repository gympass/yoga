## Writing for accessibility

Writing for accessibility goes through making everything on the page available
as text, organize content, and guide all readers during the navigation.

Depending on the audience and country, there may be laws governing the level of
accessibility required, but at the very least an accessible version should be
available.

### Basics

We write for a diverse audience of readers who interact with our content in
different ways. We aim to make our content accessible to all of them.

As you write, consider the following:

- Would this language make sense to someone who doesn’t work here?
- Could someone quickly scan this document and understand the material?
- If someone can’t see the colors, images or video, is the message still clear?

### Guidelines

#### Avoid directional language

Avoid directional instructions and any language that requires the reader to see
the layout or design of the page. This is helpful for many reasons, including
layout changes on mobile.

- **Do:** Select from these options, (with the steps listed after the title)
- **Don't:** Select from the options in the right sidebar.

#### Use headers

Never skip a header level for styling reasons.

#### Apply a hierarchy

Put the most important information first. Place similar topics in the same
paragraph, and clearly separate different topics with headings. This improves
scannability and encourages better understanding. But, please, make it natural.

#### Label forms

Label inputs with clear names, and use appropriate tags. Think carefully about
what fields are necessary, and especially which ones you mark as required. Label
required fields clearly. The shorter the form, the better.

#### Use descriptive links

Links should provide information on the associated action or destination. Avoid
“click here” or “learn more.”

#### Use plain language

Write short sentences and use familiar words. Avoid jargon and slang. If you
need to use an abbreviation or acronym that people may not understand,
explain what it means on first reference.

#### Use textual equivalents for images

- **Alt text.** It's the most basic form of image description and, ideally, has
  up to 5 words. Only the main information about the image. It's exclusively
  descriptive, literal, and explains to the blind or low-vision user what is in
  an image that complements a content. But if it's merely a decorative image,
  you don't need to add alt text.
  - **Do:** 6 friends doing bodybuilding.
  - **Don't:** Group of 6 friends, 3 men and 3 women, using different weight
    machines in a neighborhood gym.
- **Title.** Text that appears when you mouseover the image. This kind of
  description has no character limit.
- **Longdesc.** When you have a complex image, unable to be fully described
  through title and alt, you must use the longdesc attribute. This attribute
  is intended to relate an image to a more detailed description inserted in an
  alternative HTML page.

### Make sure closed captioning is available

Thinking about users who are deaf or hard of hearing, closed captioning or
transcripts should be available for all videos.

### Avoid big scrolls

This is a problem for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers and
keyboard commands. They have difficult on navigating the screen and searching
for a specific content.

### Think about visual elements in favor of clear reading

3 tips here:

- Aim for high contrast between font and background colors.
- Images should not be the only method of communication, because images may not
  load or may not be seen. Evaluate if it's really necessary to use images when
  the same information could be communicated in writing.
- [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/) is one of the leading providers of web
  accessibility expertise internationally. Access whenever you have doubts or if
  you want to know more about accessibility.
